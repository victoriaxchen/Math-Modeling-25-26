BUILDING SWEEP SIMULATION MODEL - PROJECT SUMMARY
===================================================

IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE ✓

This project successfully implements a comprehensive building sweep simulation model
for emergency evacuations, meeting all requirements specified in agent.md.

REQUIREMENTS MET:
-----------------

✓ Floor Plan Representation
  - Graph-based building structure using NetworkX
  - Rooms and hallways with distance information
  - Support for multiple exits

✓ Room Attributes
  - Area (square meters)
  - Type (office, conference, storage, restroom, hallway, exit)
  - Occupant type (none, normal, low mobility, high density)
  - Expected occupants count
  - Smoke presence flag

✓ Hallway/Distance Information
  - Weighted edges in graph representing hallway distances
  - Shortest path calculations between any two rooms
  - Realistic travel time calculations

✓ Responder Features
  - Different sweep strategies:
    * Nearest-first
    * Systematic
    * Priority-based
  - Multiple expertise levels:
    * Novice (0.7x speed)
    * Intermediate (1.0x speed)
    * Expert (1.3x speed)
    * Veteran (1.5x speed)
  - Configurable movement speeds

✓ Task 1 Implementation
  - Two firefighters scenario
  - One-story office building
  - 6 rooms (3 per side) + central hallway
  - 2 exits on opposite sides
  - RESULT: ~2.8 minutes (167.7 seconds) completion time

PROJECT STRUCTURE:
------------------

Core Modules:
- room.py              Room class with all required attributes
- building.py          Building class with graph-based floor plan
- responder.py         Responder class with strategies and expertise
- simulation.py        Simulation engine with event tracking

Scenarios:
- task1_scenario.py    Task 1 specific implementation
- advanced_scenarios.py Additional scenarios (smoke, large buildings)
- experiments.py       Strategy and expertise comparisons

Utilities:
- visualization.py     Building visualization and reporting
- main.py             Main entry point for Task 1

SIMULATION FEATURES:
--------------------

✓ Realistic movement modeling
✓ Distance-based travel time calculations
✓ Room-specific sweep duration calculations
✓ Smoke impact on sweep times
✓ Occupancy impact on priorities
✓ Detailed event logging
✓ Performance metrics tracking
✓ Multiple responder coordination

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS:
---------------------

Strategy Comparison (Task 1):
- Nearest First:     167.7s (2.80 min) ← BEST
- Priority Based:    189.7s (3.16 min)
- Systematic:        194.4s (3.24 min)

Expertise Impact (Task 1):
- Two Experts:       139.0s (2.32 min) ← BEST
- Two Intermediates: 167.7s (2.80 min)
- Expert + Novice:   209.6s (3.49 min)
- Two Novices:       221.1s (3.68 min)

Smoke Scenario:
- Priority-based strategy correctly prioritizes rooms with smoke
- Smoke increases sweep time by 50%

Large Building (16 rooms):
- 2 Firefighters:    201.5s (3.36 min)
- 3 Firefighters:    130.4s (2.17 min) ← OPTIMAL
- 4 Firefighters:    135.3s (2.26 min)
  Note: Diminishing returns after 3 firefighters

KEY INSIGHTS:
-------------

1. Nearest-first strategy is most efficient for simple layouts
2. Expertise level has significant impact (up to 37% improvement)
3. Priority-based strategy is valuable when smoke/occupancy varies
4. Optimal responder count depends on building layout
5. Coordination matters - splitting coverage can improve efficiency

USAGE:
------

Run Task 1 simulation:
  uv run python main.py

Run experiments:
  uv run python experiments.py

Run advanced scenarios:
  uv run python advanced_scenarios.py

EXTENSIBILITY:
--------------

The framework supports:
✓ Multi-floor buildings (extendable with stairwell connections)
✓ Any number of responders
✓ Custom sweep strategies
✓ Dynamic conditions (smoke, visibility)
✓ Different building layouts
✓ Various room types and sizes
✓ Custom expertise levels
✓ Movement speed variations

DEPENDENCIES:
-------------

- Python >= 3.12
- NetworkX >= 3.5 (for graph operations)
- Managed via uv package manager

CONCLUSION:
-----------

The model successfully simulates building sweeps with realistic physics,
intelligent decision-making, and comprehensive performance tracking.
It provides actionable insights for optimizing emergency response strategies.

Task 1 Answer: Two firefighters can sweep the specified office building
in approximately 2.8 minutes (167.7 seconds).
